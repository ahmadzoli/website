---
<p>
I am a quantitative psychologist and data scientist. I received my Ph.D. in psychology (Quantitative methods) from Toulouse University where I studied prediction modelling of risk behaviors and computational methods in social sciences. Currently, I work as a Post Doctoral Research Fellow, Chief Investigator, and independent Data Scientist. I specialize in development of computer-based assessment and decision-making tools in the context of human behavior.
